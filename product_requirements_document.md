# Core Product Features

## 1. Drill-Based Video Upload System

Athletes upload structured training drill footage, including:

- 20-meter sprint
- 5-10-5 agility drill
- Shooting accuracy drill
- Cone dribble drill
- Shuttle endurance test

Each drill follows standardized recording guidelines.

---

## 2. Automated Performance Metric Extraction

The system extracts measurable data from uploaded footage, including:

- Sprint time
- Acceleration profile
- Change-of-direction timing
- Shot release timing proxy
- Repetition consistency
- Drill completion rate

Metrics are normalized by age and position.
